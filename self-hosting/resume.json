Then with the help of a variety open APIs (Discogs, LastFm, SoundCloud, Freebase, Google+) we pulled in contextual information and thousands of other links to these initial artists. This data is pulled from the respective sources, indexed and linked back to give credits to original data, allowing editors a great flexibility when populating the database.\n\nWe cross referenced all the APIs to filter out good data from bad data, and automated connections, while making a CMS custom built for editorial purposes. The team was able to add artists and make hundreds of connections with a few clicks.\n\nAfter the site launched, we opened up user submission of content. Here we ask people to upload photos, tracks and memories about each artist, event, venue which they have been to, and become part of their clubbing scene. The more people add to it, the more, and better connections the site will make.\nWe designed the site in a device agnostic manner, meaning that even though we are using advance technology for capable browsers and devices, those browsers that don't support javascript, or CSS3 can still get a thematically consistent experience.",
